# Facial_Emotion_Recognition_Project
Use of Convolution Neural Networks in Facial Expression Recognition (CNN). It is based on Deep CNN Architecture that the project's CNN model is derived. This project relies on the Kaggle face expression dataset, which includes seven facial emotion labels (happy, sad, surprised, fear, rage, disgust, and neutral).
